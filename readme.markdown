#Raspberry Pi files

I will post raspberry pi projects here.

Just a note, hdmi_force_hotplug=1 in the boot/config.txt will FORCE the Pi
to boot in HDMI mode, even if you have RCA attached and no HDMI attached.
You need to comment out that line if you want to use the Pi with RCA or
composite video.
